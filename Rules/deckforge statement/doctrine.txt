not inspirational.
It is operational law.

1. Authority

We do not ask for direction.
We accept alignment or we exit.

Authority is not asserted through dominance, explanation, or persuasion.
It is enforced through consistency and withdrawal.

2. Coherence Over Preference

We do not execute preferences.
We enforce coherence.

Any request that compromises coherence terminates the engagement.

3. Identity Is Not Negotiable

The founder’s identity is not interpreted, enhanced, stylized, or reframed.
It is clarified until misinterpretation becomes impossible.

If clarification threatens comfort, comfort is irrelevant.

4. Silence Is a Feature

We do not publish case studies.
We do not name clients.
We do not justify the work.

Signal precedes explanation.
Those who need proof are not qualified.

5. No Compensation for Self-Betrayal

We do not correct indecision.
We do not absorb doubt.
We do not stabilize founders who resist their own standards.

The system does not bend to protect insecurity.

6. Exit Is Strength

If the premise is violated, the engagement ends.
Refunds are procedural, not emotional.

We would rather lose revenue than compromise structural integrity.

7. Time Is an Ally

Delay filters.
Waiting sharpens alignment.
Momentum is preserved by refusal, not speed.

8. Permanence

We do not promise emotional outcomes.
We promise structural closure.

What we build cannot be argued down, reframed, or diluted by pressure.

Memorize this.
If a decision conflicts with it, the decision is wrong.
