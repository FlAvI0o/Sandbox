il prezzo non è indicato dal costo di produzione ma dal valore che possiede.
its not about the price but rather how much would it need to cost to be taken seriously.
the price means significance and tells the story of the product no description needed.
replying to a critique justifies the framing therefore its better to not reply and be misunnderstood than being
understood by everyone.
you dont encourage u create conditions to make it happen, forcing it is worthless compared to the genuine thing.
(positioning)everything exists in context(nel contesto) so does competition and its the wrong framing for us, we dont compete we solve invisiblity we shape vision and intent.
the quality is reality not performance the efforteless mastery is designed to be consistent trought the funnel.
underneath everything we sell PERMISSION to feel appreciated,validated and accepted.
the ritual provides stucture the brand provides the story,together they provide PERMISSION.
we promise only one thing, that he can FEEL aweare of his vision trough the focal point(our product) that way it has weight therefore value that was beforehand invisible.
they wont get what they want for certain so we hand them possibility
