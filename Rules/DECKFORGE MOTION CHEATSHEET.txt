--DIRECTED BY FLAVIO DONNINI--


🎞 1. Motion Philosophy (the rules everything follows)
A. Gravity
Elements rise upward when entering.
Never drop downward.
Upward = intentional, crafted, cinematic.

B. Weight
Nothing is weightless.
Every movement has:

a slow start

a confident finish

no bounce

no spring

C. Inertia
Large elements move slower.
Small elements move faster.
This creates hierarchy.

D. Flow
Horizontal motion = narrative
Vertical motion = reveal
Opacity = emotional pacing

E. Rhythm
Use longer durations than typical UI:

600ms

1000ms

1200ms

This is what makes it feel cinematic instead of “UI-ish”.

🎚 2. Motion Tokens ( Tailwind layer)
These are the building blocks of DeckForge motion.

Easings
ease-df-soft → cinematic ease-out

ease-df-heavy → hero-level weight

ease-df-snappy → quick but still premium

Durations
duration-df-short → 250ms

duration-df-medium → 600ms

duration-df-long → 1000ms

Animations
animate-df-rise-soft → default reveal

animate-df-rise-hero → hero sections

animate-df-float-slow → subtle ambient motion

animate-df-marquee-fast → horizontal flow

animate-df-marquee-fast-reverse → counterflow

These are your verbs.

🧩 3. Motion Utilities ( CSS layer)
These are your adjectives.

Reveal
.df-reveal

.df-reveal-active

.df-reveal-subtle

.df-reveal-subtle-active

Scroll Snap
.df-snap-y

.df-snap-section

.df-magnetic-container

.df-magnetic-section

Ambient
.animate-df-float-slow

.animate-df-marquee-fast

🏛 4. COMPONENT MOTION MAP
This is the real magic — the rules for every component.

This is where DeckForge becomes a directed experience.

🟣 HERO SECTION
Entry animation:

animate-df-rise-hero on headline

animate-df-rise-soft on subtext

animate-df-float-slow on decorative elements

Scroll behavior:

fades out at 10–20% scroll

scales down slightly (scale-[0.98])

opacity drops faster than movement

Interaction:

no hover animations on hero text

hero must feel untouchable

🟣 NAVBAR
Entry:

no animation on load

must feel immediate

Scroll behavior:

hide on scroll down (velocity > 0.2)

show on scroll up

background transitions with ease-df-soft

Interaction:

links use duration-df-short ease-df-snappy

underline or glow on hover, never movement

🟣 DECK CARDS (your signature)
Entry:

staggered df-reveal

80–120ms delay between cards

Scroll behavior:

slight parallax on scroll (1–3px)

never rotate

never bounce

Hover:

scale to 1.015

shadow intensifies (shadow-df)

transition: duration-df-medium ease-df-soft

Interaction:

click → subtle press (scale-[0.98])

🟣 MARQUEE / FLOW ELEMENTS
Entry:

no reveal

they should already be moving

Motion:

animate-df-marquee-fast

reverse layer uses animate-df-marquee-fast-reverse

Rules:

never stop

never accelerate

never jitter

🟣 SECTION BLOCKS
Entry:

df-reveal

threshold: 20% viewport

unobserve after reveal

Scroll behavior:

no parallax unless intentional

maintain vertical rhythm

Interaction:

minimal

content should feel “placed”, not reactive

🟣 BUTTONS
Entry:

fade only (animate-fade-in)

no movement

Hover:

scale to 1.03

glow using shadow-df

easing: ease-df-snappy

Active:

scale to 0.97

🟣 LOGO
Entry:

fade-in only

no movement

Hover:

no hover animation

we don’t animate our logo

🟣 FOOTER
Entry:

df-reveal-subtle

slower than sections

Scroll behavior:

static

no parallax

🧠 5. The DeckForge Motion Hierarchy
This is the rule that keeps everything consistent:

Hero > Deck Cards > Sections > Footer
Meaning:

Hero gets the heaviest motion

Deck cards get the most personality

Sections get clean reveals

Footer gets subtle motion

This prevents “motion noise”.

🔥 6. The DeckForge Motion Commandments
No bounce. Ever.

No spring physics.

No random durations.

No default Tailwind easings.

Opacity always pairs with movement.

Large elements move slower.

Motion must reinforce hierarchy.

Motion must reinforce narrative.

Motion must feel handcrafted.

Motion must feel like DeckForge
