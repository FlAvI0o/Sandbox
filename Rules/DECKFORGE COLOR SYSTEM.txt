🧱 1. Core Palette

Everything breathes because of this.

🧭 2. Usage Rules
Rule 1 — White is the default background
Every page starts white.
Every section breathes.
This is my editorial foundation.

Rule 2 — Black is the voice
Typography is the anchor.
Strong, minimal, premium.

Rule 3 — Purple is sacred
Used  only when something truly matters:

main CTA

key highlight

brand signature moments

Never overuse it.
Never decorate with it.

Rule 4 — Grays create structure
Grays are your scaffolding.
They separate sections without breaking the white theme.

Rule 5 — No other colors
DeckForge is monochrome + purple.
No blues.
No reds.
No greens.
No gradients.
No color noise.

🎬 4. Emotional Tone
the color palette must always feel:

clean

editorial

premium

handcrafted

minimal

founder‑led

trustworthy

modern

Nothing loud.
Nothing playful.
Nothing startup‑y.

This is a studio, not a SaaS.

🚫 5. Forbidden Colors
These break the DeckForge identity instantly:

neon anything

saturated colors

gradients

blue default links

red error states (use muted gray instead)

green success states (use subtle black text instead)

yellow highlights

orange accents

DeckForge is white + black + purple.
Nothing else.

🖼️ 6. Image Treatment
Founder Photos
natural colors

slight desaturation

no filters

no warm tones

no cinematic darkening

keep the white theme intact

Project Images
place inside white frames

avoid overly colorful screenshots

keep everything neutral and premium

🎞️ 7. Motion + Color Integration
Motion must respect the white theme:

soft fades

gentle rises

no dark overlays

no color‑changing animations

no purple flashes

no heavy shadows

Motion should feel editorial, not cinematic‑dark.

⭐ 8. The DeckForge Color Philosophy
my palette is designed to:

make  typography feel sharp

make  motion feel handcrafted

make  brand feel premium

make  identity feel founder‑led

avoid the “AI template” look

avoid the “dark SaaS” aesthetic

create clarity and trust

DeckForge is white, minimal, intentional, premium.
